Requirement:

 Sender:
    - simulates and sends at least two Battery / Charging parameters
    - sends fifty readings in a stream
    - can either generate values for the parameters, or read from a file
    - uses console output to communicate the parameters.

Breakdown:
    1. Battery parameters
        1.1 SOC - State Of Charge.
        1.2 Charge Rate.
    
    2.Define the class for Data
        -class contains 1 private 50 data float variable
        -2 public member function
            -generating the 50 data points. values will be start from increment value and keep on adding passed by function.
            -send function to copy the data to cmd line.define 
    3.Send file:- 
        sending the soc data with increment of 1.
        sending the charge data with increment of 0.1.
    Test :- 
       tc1:- checking the  data with increment of 1
